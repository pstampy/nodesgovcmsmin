The sheer scale of these engineering feats is something to behold let alone the incredible leadership you find among the employees.

Remarkably, just a decade ago low levels of production and exploration saw plans advanced to import gas from Papua New Guinea. Wind the clock forward to today, and Australia is on the cusp of becoming the world\'s largest LNG exporter, having seen more than&nbsp;$200 billion invested in the past decade. In Queensland alone, further exploration has seen gas reserves rise&nbsp;from 5000 petajoules in 2006 to 40,000 petajoules in 2012, an eightfold increase.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But just as these changes have created unbridled opportunities for investment, employment&nbsp;and export, they too have created new challenges for the domestic market. Commercial and industrial businesses which are increasingly competing against exporters for gas are finding it difficult to negotiate supply contracts, which are now being set at higher prices, for shorter periods, and with less flexibility around terms. Households too are paying more for gas than they should. These are just two of the conclusions drawn from a significant ACCC report into the east coast gas market, released last week.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Following an inquiry lasting nearly 12 months, the ACCC found that \\"new supplies from new producers are vital to promote competition and to ensure supply into the future\\".</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While the report makes clear that current gas supplies can meet domestic demand and export commitments \\"until at least 2025\\", it does make clear it is necessary to undertake a series of reforms. Without these reforms, according to the ACCC, prices will rise and supply will tighten.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This situation is made more acute by the falling international oil price, which acts as a disincentive to exploration, and the various moratoria and regulatory restrictions on gas exploration that are now in place across Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In addition, in the Northern Territory the Labor opposition is threatening its own moratorium on unconventional gas extraction if it wins the upcoming election.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So what are the reforms that are needed to create a more liquid and efficient supply market on the east coast?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>First, the ACCC recommends against putting in place a domestic reservation policy as it acts as a disincentive to investment, but rather wants governments to move away from blanket moratoria on certain gas developments and manage the risks on a case-by-case basis.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While acknowledging there may be legitimate community and environmental concerns about particular projects, the answer should not be a broad prohibition on the use of existing exploration licences. Indeed, developments could be undertaken in an environmentally sustainable and sensitive way.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Second, the ACCC recommends a new test in the regulation of gas pipelines to prevent the exercise of market power and monopoly pricing. Unlike the US, British&nbsp;and New Zealand experience, the ACCC has found that less than 20 per cent of transmission pipelines on the east coast are subject to regulation and that the current regulatory regime is focused more on the vertically integrated business model&nbsp;making it not fit for purpose. Given that the pipelines are more often than not owned by entities separate to the upstream and downstream assets, there is merit in considering the ACCC\'s proposed approach. Great care will need to be taken to respect existing contracts and encourage continued investment in pipelines as a means of ensuring security of supply.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Third, the ACCC highlights how important it is to buyers in the gas market to have sufficient market information and transparency. By requiring the provision and publication of key data around reserves, commodity and transportation prices, the problem of unequal bargaining power can be tackled.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Again, commercial sensitivities need to be taken into account, but the fact that in 99 per cent of bilateral gas contracts concluded in Australia the prices remain confidential, this is an area where reforms could be made to enhance competitive bargaining.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In producing this comprehensive report with its three sets of recommendations around the diversity of supply, pipeline regulation and market transparency, the ACCC has provided impetus for change. Indeed, its findings neatly complement the work being prepared by the Australian Energy Market Commission&nbsp;for the next COAG Energy Council meeting, set down for July.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>No doubt different jurisdictions bring to the table different views on each of the recommendations but a great opportunity is now presented to us by the ACCC in that we have a credible, evidence-based report on a complex and changing gas market which can provide the basis for a collective response.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>First published in the Australian Financial Review on 26 April 2016</em></p>\\r\\n",

In Queensland alone, further exploration has seen gas reserves rise from 5000 petajoules in 2006 to 40,000 petajoules in 2012, an eightfold increase.</p>\\n<p>But just as these changes have created unbridled opportunities for investment, employment and export, they too have created new challenges for the domestic market. Commercial and industrial businesses which are increasingly competing against exporters for gas are finding it difficult to negotiate supply contracts, which are now being set at higher prices, for shorter periods, and with less flexibility around terms. Households too are paying more for gas than they should. These are just two of the conclusions drawn from a significant ACCC report into the east coast gas market, released last week.</p>\\n<p>Following an inquiry lasting nearly 12 months, the ACCC found that \\"new supplies from new producers are vital to promote competition and to ensure supply into the future\\".</p>\\n<p>While the report makes clear that current gas supplies can meet domestic demand and export commitments \\"until at least 2025\\", it does make clear it is necessary to undertake a series of reforms. Without these reforms, according to the ACCC, prices will rise and supply will tighten.</p>\\n<p>This situation is made more acute by the falling international oil price, which acts as a disincentive to exploration, and the various moratoria and regulatory restrictions on gas exploration that are now in place across Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania.</p>\\n<p>In addition, in the Northern Territory the Labor opposition is threatening its own moratorium on unconventional gas extraction if it wins the upcoming election.</p>\\n<p>So what are the reforms that are needed to create a more liquid and efficient supply market on the east coast?</p>\\n<p>First, the ACCC recommends against putting in place a domestic reservation policy as it acts as a disincentive to investment, but rather wants governments to move away from blanket moratoria on certain gas developments and manage the risks on a case-by-case basis.</p>\\n<p>While acknowledging there may be legitimate community and environmental concerns about particular projects, the answer should not be a broad prohibition on the use of existing exploration licences. Indeed, developments could be undertaken in an environmentally sustainable and sensitive way.</p>\\n<p>Second, the ACCC recommends a new test in the regulation of gas pipelines to prevent the exercise of market power and monopoly pricing. Unlike the US, British and New Zealand experience, the ACCC has found that less than 20 per cent of transmission pipelines on the east coast are subject to regulation and that the current regulatory regime is focused more on the vertically integrated business model making it not fit for purpose. Given that the pipelines are more often than not owned by entities separate to the upstream and downstream assets, there is merit in considering the ACCC\'s proposed approach. Great care will need to be taken to respect existing contracts and encourage continued investment in pipelines as a means of ensuring security of supply.</p>\\n<p>Third, the ACCC highlights how important it is to buyers in the gas market to have sufficient market information and transparency. By requiring the provision and publication of key data around reserves, commodity and transportation prices, the problem of unequal bargaining power can be tackled.</p>\\n<p>Again, commercial sensitivities need to be taken into account, but the fact that in 99 per cent of bilateral gas contracts concluded in Australia the prices remain confidential, this is an area where reforms could be made to enhance competitive bargaining.</p>\\n<p>In producing this comprehensive report with its three sets of recommendations around the diversity of supply, pipeline regulation and market transparency, the ACCC has provided impetus for change. Indeed, its findings neatly complement the work being prepared by the Australian Energy Market Commission for the next COAG Energy Council meeting, set down for July.</p>\\n<p>No doubt different jurisdictions bring to the table different views on each of the recommendations but a great opportunity is now presented to us by the ACCC in that we have a credible, evidence-based report on a complex and changing gas market which can provide the basis for a collective response.</p>\\n<p><em>First published in the Australian Financial Review on 26 April 2016</em></p>\\n",

            \'value\' => "<p>The global energy and resources sector is under enormous strain. The Australian Index of Bulk Commodities Prices has fallen more than 20 per cent in the past 12&nbsp;months. Oil has gone from a peak of $US140 a barrel in 2008 to about $US30 a barrel today, having fallen nearly 20 per cent in the first weeks of 2016.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This downward spiral in prices has led to increased pressure on company balance sheets, leading to significant share price corrections and job losses. Some of our blue-chip resources stocks, core holdings for millions of Australians in their retirement accounts, were down more than 30 per cent over the last year and major multi­nationals such as miner Anglo American are seeking to reduce their global headcount by up to 85,000.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The reasons for these significant falls in resource prices are a complex combination of supply and demand dynamics that differ to some extent according to the commodity in question. For Australia, two of the most important developments have ­occurred around iron ore and oil. Iron ore is Australia’s No 1 export, producing $66 billion worth of ­export income in 2014, and oil is an important benchmark for the price of LNG, Australia’s third-largest resource export, earning $18bn worth of ­export income in 2014. Australian LNG exports are estimated to reach $49bn in 2020, when we overtake Qatar as the world’s largest LNG exporter.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the case of iron ore, strong global demand has been led by China. Just a few years ago, its ­demand for iron ore was growing at 19 per cent a year, with China representing 50 per cent of the global market. Iron ore prices reacted accordingly, increasing from less than $US20 a tonne to a peak of more than $US180 in the decade to 2011. With China building thousands of skyscrapers, more than 10,000 kilometres of high-speed rail links and producing 14 million vehicles a year, there was a huge demand for iron ore to meet the needs of this remarkable industrial transformation. Conscious of the oppor­tunities, the biggest producers of iron ore, BHP, Rio and Vale, made record investments in their supply chains, ­increasing their production from 581 million tonnes in 2009 to 870 million tonnes by 2014. Major projects under­taken by Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue and Gina Rinehart’s Roy Hill have also come online.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the same time as higher volumes were hitting the market following these large-scale increases in production, the Chinese economy was transitioning from ­investment to consumption and more sustainable levels of growth.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The pricing of oil has also been dramatically affected by changes in the supply and demand dyna­mic. In 2008 when the oil price hit its peak, global demand for oil was less than it is today. What has changed is supply. The United States has gone from being a net importer of oil to an exporter, ­increasing its oil exports sevenfold over the past three years and having its first LNG cargo ready for export. This is the net effect of the shale gas revolution that has seen thousands of wells drilled in the US over recent years.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The largest producer of oil, Saudi Arabia, has also expanded production by more than 5 per cent this year alone. With an estimated 260 billion barrels of ­reserves and a production cost well of less than $20 a barrel, the Saudis’ ability to drive the higher cost producers in Venezuela, Russia and Iran into the red is real. Add to the mix the geostrategic motive as seen from Riyadh and one can better understand why many commentators believe lower oil prices are here to stay.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So one can be forgiven for thinking it’s not a pretty picture. Lower iron ore, oil and other commodity prices such as coal, copper, nickel and lead have all had an ­impact on export earnings, share prices and employ­ment. But it won’t always be thus. History tells us the commodity cycle moves in peaks and troughs and often there is a major investment in production at times of high demand that leads to price corrections like the ones we have recently seen.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Price volatility is simply part and parcel of the history of the ­resource sector, but most impor­tantly the long-term fundamentals of the sector remain strong.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The combination of global production growth, rising middle classes and rapid urbanisation will require a greater demand for our energy and resources in this decade and beyond. That is why the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will increase by a third between now and 2040, and the US Energy Information Administration says “we are in one of these likely dips that go below what replacement costs really are so we will see a ­recovery”, predicting the oil price to reach close to $US50 next year. And in the iron ore space, these positive global trends have led senior figures like Andrew Harding, Rio Tinto’s chief executive of iron ore, to suggest that emerging markets will drive demand for iron ore, with non-Chinese demand for steel, particularly from ASEAN and India, to be 65 per cent greater in 2030 than it is today.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>India is a fascinating story. With nearly 1.3 billion people, its per capita steel consumption is 27 per cent of the global average and just a fraction of that of China. In 2014 China’s steel consumption was 530kg a person, whereas India’s was just 60kg. With plans to triple domestic steel production by 2025, the Modi government is preparing India for rapid urbanisation and domestic growth. This creates great opportunities for Australia to not only export iron ore to India but to supply China whose large-scale integrated steel mills are increasingly exporting to emerging new markets, including Vietnam and India. In the first half of 2015, Chinese steel exports were up 27 per cent with a 70 per cent ­increase to Vietnam and a 62 per cent rise to India. It is this focus in China on the steel export market that has led in part to China buying a record 96.3 million tonnes of iron ore last month. Prices may be down, but volumes are up.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Of all the major resource ­exporting countries, Australia is best placed to capi­talise on future demand. We are viewed as a reli­able, high-quality supplier that is highly innovative, efficient and proximate to key markets. A good example is that Vale has traditionally taken more than 40 days to ship iron ore to China compared with just nine days from Australia.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Australian household names Rio, BHP and Fortescue are leading the world in new technology, operating trucks, trains and drilling equipment at their Pilbara mines remotely from their hi-tech operations centres in Perth, 1500km away. Australians would be proud to know, just as I was, that 60 per cent of the world’s mining software is written here in Australia, and that one in 10 dollars of all business R&amp;D spent in Australia is undertaken by the resources ­sector. The relative size and dominant global market positions that many of our resource producers have built sees them enjoy economies of scale that allow them to weather low points in the pricing cycle. In fact, when it comes to iron ore, more than three quarters of Australia’s production is in the bottom half of the global cost curve. A falling Australian dollar and lower ­energy input costs also help to strengthen our global ­competitiveness.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Australia is also opening up new markets and reducing bar­riers to existing markets through free trade agreements. For example, the China-Australia FTA eliminates the tariffs of 3 per cent and 6 per cent on coking coal and thermal coal respectively. A free trade deal with India also has the potential to reduce tariffs on the export of resources.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Coalition is committed to cutting the cost of doing business in Australia for resource com­panies with reforms to deregulation, tax, industrial relations and infrastructure all having an ­impact. A standout is the one-stop shop for environmental approvals, helping to streamline federal and state processes and saving companies up to $546m a year.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These and other reforms are important if we are to maintain a strong pipeline of resource investments in the future. It must be understood that despite the challenging global environment, there are still more than $400bn worth of resource investments in Australia that are at the committed or feasibility stage. In just the past two months, Rio Tinto announced a $2.6bn expansion of its Amrun bauxite project in Queensland and Woodside and its partners ­announced a $2.75bn expansion of its North West Shelf project. These two projects alone will create thousands of jobs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s not just Australian com­panies that are at the forefront of global energy and resources markets, it’s Australians who are playing a lead role. Late last year I met with chief executives of Rio, Glencore and Anglo American, all of whom are Australian.

            \'safe_value\' => "<p>The global energy and resources sector is under enormous strain. The Australian Index of Bulk Commodities Prices has fallen more than 20 per cent in the past 12 months. Oil has gone from a peak of $US140 a barrel in 2008 to about $US30 a barrel today, having fallen nearly 20 per cent in the first weeks of 2016.</p>\\n<p>This downward spiral in prices has led to increased pressure on company balance sheets, leading to significant share price corrections and job losses. Some of our blue-chip resources stocks, core holdings for millions of Australians in their retirement accounts, were down more than 30 per cent over the last year and major multi­nationals such as miner Anglo American are seeking to reduce their global headcount by up to 85,000.</p>\\n<p>The reasons for these significant falls in resource prices are a complex combination of supply and demand dynamics that differ to some extent according to the commodity in question. For Australia, two of the most important developments have ­occurred around iron ore and oil. Iron ore is Australia’s No 1 export, producing $66 billion worth of ­export income in 2014, and oil is an important benchmark for the price of LNG, Australia’s third-largest resource export, earning $18bn worth of ­export income in 2014. Australian LNG exports are estimated to reach $49bn in 2020, when we overtake Qatar as the world’s largest LNG exporter.</p>\\n<p>In the case of iron ore, strong global demand has been led by China. Just a few years ago, its ­demand for iron ore was growing at 19 per cent a year, with China representing 50 per cent of the global market. Iron ore prices reacted accordingly, increasing from less than $US20 a tonne to a peak of more than $US180 in the decade to 2011. With China building thousands of skyscrapers, more than 10,000 kilometres of high-speed rail links and producing 14 million vehicles a year, there was a huge demand for iron ore to meet the needs of this remarkable industrial transformation. Conscious of the oppor­tunities, the biggest producers of iron ore, BHP, Rio and Vale, made record investments in their supply chains, ­increasing their production from 581 million tonnes in 2009 to 870 million tonnes by 2014. Major projects under­taken by Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue and Gina Rinehart’s Roy Hill have also come online.</p>\\n<p>At the same time as higher volumes were hitting the market following these large-scale increases in production, the Chinese economy was transitioning from ­investment to consumption and more sustainable levels of growth.</p>\\n<p>The pricing of oil has also been dramatically affected by changes in the supply and demand dyna­mic. In 2008 when the oil price hit its peak, global demand for oil was less than it is today. What has changed is supply. The United States has gone from being a net importer of oil to an exporter, ­increasing its oil exports sevenfold over the past three years and having its first LNG cargo ready for export. This is the net effect of the shale gas revolution that has seen thousands of wells drilled in the US over recent years.</p>\\n<p>The largest producer of oil, Saudi Arabia, has also expanded production by more than 5 per cent this year alone. With an estimated 260 billion barrels of ­reserves and a production cost well of less than $20 a barrel, the Saudis’ ability to drive the higher cost producers in Venezuela, Russia and Iran into the red is real. Add to the mix the geostrategic motive as seen from Riyadh and one can better understand why many commentators believe lower oil prices are here to stay.</p>\\n<p>So one can be forgiven for thinking it’s not a pretty picture. Lower iron ore, oil and other commodity prices such as coal, copper, nickel and lead have all had an ­impact on export earnings, share prices and employ­ment. But it won’t always be thus. History tells us the commodity cycle moves in peaks and troughs and often there is a major investment in production at times of high demand that leads to price corrections like the ones we have recently seen.</p>\\n<p>Price volatility is simply part and parcel of the history of the ­resource sector, but most impor­tantly the long-term fundamentals of the sector remain strong.</p>\\n<p>The combination of global production growth, rising middle classes and rapid urbanisation will require a greater demand for our energy and resources in this decade and beyond. That is why the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will increase by a third between now and 2040, and the US Energy Information Administration says “we are in one of these likely dips that go below what replacement costs really are so we will see a ­recovery”, predicting the oil price to reach close to $US50 next year. And in the iron ore space, these positive global trends have led senior figures like Andrew Harding, Rio Tinto’s chief executive of iron ore, to suggest that emerging markets will drive demand for iron ore, with non-Chinese demand for steel, particularly from ASEAN and India, to be 65 per cent greater in 2030 than it is today.</p>\\n<p>India is a fascinating story. With nearly 1.3 billion people, its per capita steel consumption is 27 per cent of the global average and just a fraction of that of China. In 2014 China’s steel consumption was 530kg a person, whereas India’s was just 60kg. With plans to triple domestic steel production by 2025, the Modi government is preparing India for rapid urbanisation and domestic growth. This creates great opportunities for Australia to not only export iron ore to India but to supply China whose large-scale integrated steel mills are increasingly exporting to emerging new markets, including Vietnam and India. In the first half of 2015, Chinese steel exports were up 27 per cent with a 70 per cent ­increase to Vietnam and a 62 per cent rise to India. It is this focus in China on the steel export market that has led in part to China buying a record 96.3 million tonnes of iron ore last month. Prices may be down, but volumes are up.</p>\\n<p>Of all the major resource ­exporting countries, Australia is best placed to capi­talise on future demand. We are viewed as a reli­able, high-quality supplier that is highly innovative, efficient and proximate to key markets. A good example is that Vale has traditionally taken more than 40 days to ship iron ore to China compared with just nine days from Australia.</p>\\n<p>Australian household names Rio, BHP and Fortescue are leading the world in new technology, operating trucks, trains and drilling equipment at their Pilbara mines remotely from their hi-tech operations centres in Perth, 1500km away. Australians would be proud to know, just as I was, that 60 per cent of the world’s mining software is written here in Australia, and that one in 10 dollars of all business R&amp;D spent in Australia is undertaken by the resources ­sector. The relative size and dominant global market positions that many of our resource producers have built sees them enjoy economies of scale that allow them to weather low points in the pricing cycle. In fact, when it comes to iron ore, more than three quarters of Australia’s production is in the bottom half of the global cost curve. A falling Australian dollar and lower ­energy input costs also help to strengthen our global ­competitiveness.</p>\\n<p>Australia is also opening up new markets and reducing bar­riers to existing markets through free trade agreements. For example, the China-Australia FTA eliminates the tariffs of 3 per cent and 6 per cent on coking coal and thermal coal respectively. A free trade deal with India also has the potential to reduce tariffs on the export of resources.</p>\\n<p>The Coalition is committed to cutting the cost of doing business in Australia for resource com­panies with reforms to deregulation, tax, industrial relations and infrastructure all having an ­impact. A standout is the one-stop shop for environmental approvals, helping to streamline federal and state processes and saving companies up to $546m a year.</p>\\n<p>These and other reforms are important if we are to maintain a strong pipeline of resource investments in the future. It must be understood that despite the challenging global environment, there are still more than $400bn worth of resource investments in Australia that are at the committed or feasibility stage. In just the past two months, Rio Tinto announced a $2.6bn expansion of its Amrun bauxite project in Queensland and Woodside and its partners ­announced a $2.75bn expansion of its North West Shelf project. These two projects alone will create thousands of jobs.</p>\\n<p>It’s not just Australian com­panies that are at the forefront of global energy and resources markets, it’s Australians who are playing a lead role. Late last year I met with chief executives of Rio, Glencore and Anglo American, all of whom are Australian. Despite the challenges they face, they empha­sised the ­resilience of the local ­resource sector, and pointed out just how impor­tant resources are to the global economy.

But apparently there is still a Brisbane line, above which different rules apply.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The proposed Adani Carmichael coal mine in the Galilee Basin is a game changer for North Queensland because it is not just about this mine. It will be the first time that a new coal basin is opened in Australia for more than 40 years. If a rail line is built from the Galilee to Abbot Point it has the potential to spur another three mining ventures at least.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The level of wealth that could be unlocked is comparable to that of the Hunter Valley or the Bowen Basin.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That is why it must be a priority for a national government that is serious about developing our nation. There are risks for any first mover so while Adani may yet decide to take all those risks on itself, it may not. Given the wider benefits to the Australian economy, it makes sense for the Government to look at its request for a loan to help build the railway.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The railway is a $2.5 billion, 388 kilometre investment, capable of carrying 40 million tonnes of coal per year. It will be the first major standard gauge railway line in Queensland. It will carry around 25,000 tonnes of coal at a time, up from the less than 10,000 tonnes per train on Queensland’s narrow gauge railways.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Adani have always proposed the line as common user. Of that 40 million tonnes per year, it will use 25 million tonnes and has offered the other 15 million tonnes capacity to other mines. A loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) would stipulate that the rail line be open access.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Any loan has to stack up for the Commonwealth and that is why the Government has appointed an independent, skills-based board to the NAIF. The NAIF was supported by the Parliament and we should let the independent board do its job. The potential for a loan to the Galilee Basin rail line was flagged during the Parliamentary debate before it was supported by Labor.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That is why it is disappointing to see Bill Shorten already dismiss the prospect of a loan before the independent NAIF has done its work. Labor’s position compromises the independence of the NAIF and the wider support for northern development. Mr Shorten is also at odds with his Queensland Labor colleagues who wrote to the Federal Government earlier this year proposing a loan from the NAIF to build the rail line.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Federal Labor’s opposition is probably best explained by its ideological objection to coal. That’s counterproductive because India will expand its use of coal regardless, and on current projections will almost double its imports by 2040. It would be best for the environment if India uses higher quality Australian coal.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The development of almost every minerals province in Australia has involved government investment. The exception is the Pilbara but the private rail lines that criss-cross there would be less than ideal for the cattle sector in North Queensland.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Government is focused on supporting a new minerals province that will generate billions of dollars of wealth, create thousands of jobs and strengthen our ties with an important Asian country that wants the same benefits that Australians take as a given: affordable and accessible power.</p>\\r\\n",

There are risks for any first mover so while Adani may yet decide to take all those risks on itself, it may not. Given the wider benefits to the Australian economy, it makes sense for the Government to look at its request for a loan to help build the railway.</p>\\n<p>The railway is a $2.5 billion, 388 kilometre investment, capable of carrying 40 million tonnes of coal per year. It will be the first major standard gauge railway line in Queensland. It will carry around 25,000 tonnes of coal at a time, up from the less than 10,000 tonnes per train on Queensland’s narrow gauge railways.</p>\\n<p>Adani have always proposed the line as common user. Of that 40 million tonnes per year, it will use 25 million tonnes and has offered the other 15 million tonnes capacity to other mines. A loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) would stipulate that the rail line be open access.</p>\\n<p>Any loan has to stack up for the Commonwealth and that is why the Government has appointed an independent, skills-based board to the NAIF. The NAIF was supported by the Parliament and we should let the independent board do its job. The potential for a loan to the Galilee Basin rail line was flagged during the Parliamentary debate before it was supported by Labor.</p>\\n<p>That is why it is disappointing to see Bill Shorten already dismiss the prospect of a loan before the independent NAIF has done its work. Labor’s position compromises the independence of the NAIF and the wider support for northern development. Mr Shorten is also at odds with his Queensland Labor colleagues who wrote to the Federal Government earlier this year proposing a loan from the NAIF to build the rail line.</p>\\n<p>Federal Labor’s opposition is probably best explained by its ideological objection to coal. That’s counterproductive because India will expand its use of coal regardless, and on current projections will almost double its imports by 2040. It would be best for the environment if India uses higher quality Australian coal.</p>\\n<p>The development of almost every minerals province in Australia has involved government investment. The exception is the Pilbara but the private rail lines that criss-cross there would be less than ideal for the cattle sector in North Queensland.</p>\\n<p>The Government is focused on supporting a new minerals province that will generate billions of dollars of wealth, create thousands of jobs and strengthen our ties with an important Asian country that wants the same benefits that Australians take as a given: affordable and accessible power.</p>\\n",

This will provide sustainable, well-paying jobs for the local community, not just on site but also in surrounding areas. Upgrades to local infrastructure such as roads and communication links will follow, and other services requested by the local community will be considered.

To date, local communities around the six sites have been engaging constructively and actively with the Government to discuss the proposal.

England, France, Spain, South Africa and other comparable countries have put in place a national radioactive waste facility.

This is simply not true. The successful site will have a facility purpose-built to dispose of the low level waste such as surgical gloves, test tubes, eyewear and gowns that have come into contact with nuclear medicine produced in Australia. It will also have a separate building to store intermediate level waste that was generated by the reprocessing of the fuel rods from the research reactor at the Lucas Heights campus of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), as well as disused radioactive sources that were once used for purposes such as radiotherapy in hospitals. These waste materials, both of a low and intermediate nature, were produced here in Australia. We will not be taking waste produced overseas to store in this facility.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It must be understood that currently Australia’s low and intermediate waste is stored at more than 100 sites around the country.&nbsp; Hospitals, universities, ANSTO and CSIRO are all temporary stores for these products. With waste having been accumulated for up to six decades, capacity is being reached making it time for Australia to build a single purpose-built facility like there is in other parts of the world.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The facility will be built to the highest safety, security and environmental standards and it has been made very clear by ANSTO that there will be no radiation emitted from the site. It may be reassuring for people to know that a worker at the proposed waste management facility who comes into daily contact with the waste would have to work more than 10 years at the facility to be subject to the same amount of radiation as a patient undergoing a single CT chest scan.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Building a national radioactive waste management facility is Australia’s best option and given the importance of nuclear medicine to our community with more than 10,000 patient doses produced in Australia each week, it is one whose success we all have a stake in.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the weeks ahead the Government looks forward to continuing its constructive discussions with the communities. We stand ready to answer any questions there may be because we want communities to be fully informed. At the end of this initial consultation period, I will be seeking two to three communities that are willing to move to the next stage of the process and begin an important and valuable partnership with the Federal Government.

Three of the successfully nominated sites are in South Australia, with one each from Queensland, NSW and the Northern Territory.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Each site has been put forward voluntarily by local landholders and rigorously assessed against a range of geological and economic criteria as being potentially viable.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There will now be extensive consultation over a 120-day per­iod with the relevant local communities, led by my department.

The owners of the land will receive up to four times the market value of their holding, and the local community will receive about $10 million, which may be put towards a fund for various community projects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Previous government efforts to identify and choose a suitable site have led to false starts such as at Muckaty and Arcoona stations in the 2000s. This process has relied solely on voluntary nominations and will be consultative right the way through.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>However, in any discussion about the storage of radioactive nuclear waste, there will always be a degree of misinformation and understandable apprehension that can be put to rest with the facts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>First, all radioactive waste stored at the site will have been generated from activities in Australia. This could include contam­inated laboratory waste such as glassware, plastic, paper and protectiv­e clothing, as well as disused radioactive sources used in medical treatments and presently stored in hospitals.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It may surprise some people to know that about one-third of all procedures in modern hos­pitals involve radiation or radioactivity. Every week, ANSTO delivers about 10,000 doses of nuclear medicine to more than 250 med­ical facilities here and overseas.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Second, the establishment of a single storage site will produce a better safety and environmental outcome for the community.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Presently, radioactive mater­ial is stored at about 100 sites across the country, many in built-up areas, which are nearing capacity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The storage of the waste in an appropriately built and located facil­ity will minimise the possib­ility of accidental loss and is consistent with world’s best practice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Countries comparable to Australia, such as Britain, France, Spain and South Africa, all have their own domestic nuclear waste storage facilities and have had for some time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Third, the search for a nation­al radioactive waste storage facility is a bipartisan endeavour, first announced by the Keating government in 1992. This bipartisanship was reinforced in 2012 with the passage of the Nation­al Radioactive Waste Management Act, which put in place a process of voluntary nomin­ation of sites.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Both sides of politics understand the great benefits Australians derive from the nuclear­ industry and acknow­ledge our international respon­sibility to make approp­riate arrangements to store our own waste.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Fourth, today’s announcement is completely separate to the South Australian royal commission under way into all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Identifying a suitable facility to store Australia’s low-level and inter­mediate waste is quite distinct from the broader discussion sparked by the royal commission about the potential for Australia to produce nuclear power or to store waste from other countries.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When the royal commission presents its findings, expected next May, the commonwealth government will then respond.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Today’s announcement is an important step forward in finding a solution to what has been a 30-year challenge.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If, in the end, after further rigorous analysis and consultation, one of the six possible sites ticks all the right boxes — geological, economic, engineering and envir­onmental — while enjoying community support, then Australia and all who benefit from our nuclear industr­y will be far better off.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Published in <em>The Australian</em>, 13 November 2015. </strong></p>\\r\\n",

This could include contam­inated laboratory waste such as glassware, plastic, paper and protectiv­e clothing, as well as disused radioactive sources used in medical treatments and presently stored in hospitals.</p>\\n<p>It may surprise some people to know that about one-third of all procedures in modern hos­pitals involve radiation or radioactivity. Every week, ANSTO delivers about 10,000 doses of nuclear medicine to more than 250 med­ical facilities here and overseas.</p>\\n<p>Second, the establishment of a single storage site will produce a better safety and environmental outcome for the community.</p>\\n<p>Presently, radioactive mater­ial is stored at about 100 sites across the country, many in built-up areas, which are nearing capacity.</p>\\n<p>The storage of the waste in an appropriately built and located facil­ity will minimise the possib­ility of accidental loss and is consistent with world’s best practice.</p>\\n<p>Countries comparable to Australia, such as Britain, France, Spain and South Africa, all have their own domestic nuclear waste storage facilities and have had for some time.</p>\\n<p>Third, the search for a nation­al radioactive waste storage facility is a bipartisan endeavour, first announced by the Keating government in 1992. This bipartisanship was reinforced in 2012 with the passage of the Nation­al Radioactive Waste Management Act, which put in place a process of voluntary nomin­ation of sites.</p>\\n<p>Both sides of politics understand the great benefits Australians derive from the nuclear­ industry and acknow­ledge our international respon­sibility to make approp­riate arrangements to store our own waste.</p>\\n<p>Fourth, today’s announcement is completely separate to the South Australian royal commission under way into all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle.</p>\\n<p>Identifying a suitable facility to store Australia’s low-level and inter­mediate waste is quite distinct from the broader discussion sparked by the royal commission about the potential for Australia to produce nuclear power or to store waste from other countries.</p>\\n<p>When the royal commission presents its findings, expected next May, the commonwealth government will then respond.</p>\\n<p>Today’s announcement is an important step forward in finding a solution to what has been a 30-year challenge.</p>\\n<p>If, in the end, after further rigorous analysis and consultation, one of the six possible sites ticks all the right boxes — geological, economic, engineering and envir­onmental — while enjoying community support, then Australia and all who benefit from our nuclear industr­y will be far better off.</p>\\n<p><strong>Published in <em>The Australian</em>, 13 November 2015. </strong></p>\\n",
